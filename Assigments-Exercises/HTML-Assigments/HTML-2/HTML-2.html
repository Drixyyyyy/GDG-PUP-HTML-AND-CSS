    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Drixelle Morales one of your junior web developers. I am currently 19 years old, from Quezon City, and in my second year at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I am thrilled to learn new skills, especially in web development. I am also an associate in Community Relations here at GDG. I have little to no experience in web development, but I am eager to learn everything here at GDG!</p>
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I am into battle rap and I also write some pieces. I enjoy listening to music and podcasts, and sometimes I write poems.</p>
    <h2>Why BS Computer Science?</h2>
    <p>I chose BS Computer Science mainly because of its demand. :></p>
